# EX_01 - Exploring the Fundamentals and Tools of UI/UX Design

## Aim:

To explore the fundamentals of User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) design, differentiate between them using real-world case studies, understand their interdependence, and demonstrate various UI/UX design tools in detail.

## Algorithm:

1. Understand Fundamentals:

- Study the core principles of UI and UX design including usability, accessibility, responsiveness, and aesthetics.

2. Differentiate UI and UX:

- Analyze real-world applications or websites to identify and contrast UI (look and feel) and UX (user journey and experience).

3. Identify the Relationship:

- Illustrate how UI and UX work together to create seamless and effective digital products.

4. Select Design Tools:

- Choose commonly used UI/UX design tools like Figma, Adobe XD, Sketch, or InVision.

5. Demonstrate Tool Features:

- Explore features such as wireframing, prototyping, design systems, and user flow mapping.

6. Design a Sample Interface:

- Use one of the tools to create a basic UI/UX layout based on a chosen use case.

7. Review and Reflect:

- Evaluate the design based on UI/UX principles and discuss improvements.
